Depth first search algo 

Used for traversing or searching in graphs or trees
It starts from the root node, while any random node in case of graphs 
and it searches as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using backtracking. This can be described with a following recursive routine:

Given a current cell as a parameter
Mark the current cell as visited
While the current cell has any unvisited neighbour cells
Choose one of the unvisited neighbours
Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
Invoke the routine recursively for the chosen cell
which is invoked once for any initial cell in the area.

The moveTo function moves the drawing "pen" to a specified point in the canvas without drawing anything.
The lineTo function draws a straight line from the current pen position to the specified point (x, y) in the canvas.
// Stroke the path to actually draw the line
